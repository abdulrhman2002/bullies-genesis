              A. If you elect to purchase a Bullies Genesis NFT through the Site, any financial transactions that you engage in will be conducted solely through the Ethereum network.

             B. Ethereum requires the payment of a transaction fee (a ‚ÄúGas Fee‚Äù) for every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized Ethereum network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction.
